#  Key Logger Side Channel Attack

A side-channel attack does not target a program or its code directly. Rather, a side-channel attack attempts to gather information or influence the program execution of a system by measuring or exploiting indirect effects of the system or its hardware. Put simply, a side channel attack breaks cryptography by exploiting information inadvertently leaked by a system. 

This comes under Offensive part of cybersecurity.

## About Repository

Using Python and libraries including Pynput, SMTPlib, Threading, the project reveals Computer system vulnerability.
◦ Analyzing Keystroke movement, the project demonstrates the unintended revelation of Keystrokes as you type.
◦ Logs related to keystrokes are stored into a text file, which is sent to a specified email address after the mentioned interval


Pynput library which has 4 major functionality - mouse listen, mouse control ,keyboard listen, keyboard control.
Email handling is done via SMTP MIME library.


The Repository contains two main files :
- main.py - This includes the Pynput Library which takes into account the keystroke that we type in.
- mail_agger.py - This controls the code for sending mail.
- log.txt will capture all the keystrokes until you stop the program.
- control.py will give you idea about 4 major functionality of pynput.

## Getting Started

To run the KeyLogger side-channel attack, follow these steps:
1.  Open main.py and mail_agger.py into an editor.
2.  Add your email address and password into mail_agger.py for real-time experience.
